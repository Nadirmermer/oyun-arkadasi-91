# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive mobile DevOps and build engineering workflow that transforms the "PsikoOyun" React web application into production-ready Android and iOS mobile applications using Capacitor. The system will handle the complete pipeline from pre-flight project auditing to final mobile app packaging, ensuring the application meets mobile platform standards and is ready for app store distribution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile DevOps engineer, I want to perform a comprehensive pre-flight check of the React project, so that I can ensure the codebase is production-ready before mobile packaging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the pre-flight check is initiated THEN the system SHALL scan all project files for console.log statements and remove them
2. WHEN scanning for unused code THEN the system SHALL identify and remove unused variables and imports
3. WHEN checking dependencies THEN the system SHALL verify all packages in package.json are at stable versions
4. WHEN running security audit THEN the system SHALL execute npm audit and fix any identified vulnerabilities
5. WHEN validating build process THEN the system SHALL ensure npm run build creates optimized files in build/dist directory

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mobile DevOps engineer, I want to integrate Capacitor into the React project, so that I can enable cross-platform mobile app generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing Capacitor THEN the system SHALL add @capacitor/core and @capacitor/cli to the project
2. WHEN initializing Capacitor THEN the system SHALL run cap init with app name "PsikoOyun" and package ID "com.psikooyun.app"
3. WHEN configuring web directory THEN the system SHALL update capacitor.config.ts to point to the correct build output directory
4. WHEN adding platforms THEN the system SHALL install and add both Android and iOS platforms
5. WHEN platform setup is complete THEN the system SHALL verify both android and ios directories are created

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mobile DevOps engineer, I want to configure mobile-specific optimizations and assets, so that the app provides a native mobile experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating app icons THEN the system SHALL create icons for all required resolutions for both Android and iOS
2. WHEN creating splash screens THEN the system SHALL generate splash screen assets for all device sizes and orientations
3. WHEN configuring status bar THEN the system SHALL set appropriate status bar styling to match app theme
4. WHEN handling Android back button THEN the system SHALL implement proper back button behavior with exit confirmation
5. WHEN addressing screen notches THEN the system SHALL implement safe area handling using CSS env() variables
6. WHEN optimizing for mobile THEN the system SHALL ensure UI elements don't overlap with system UI elements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile DevOps engineer, I want to build and package the application for both Android and iOS platforms, so that I can create distribution-ready app packages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN synchronizing changes THEN the system SHALL run cap sync to update native projects with web changes
2. WHEN building Android package THEN the system SHALL generate signed APK or AAB files ready for Google Play Store
3. WHEN building iOS package THEN the system SHALL create Xcode project ready for App Store submission
4. WHEN opening native projects THEN the system SHALL provide commands to open projects in Android Studio and Xcode
5. WHEN packaging is complete THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for app store submission

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mobile DevOps engineer, I want to receive comprehensive deployment instructions, so that I can successfully publish the apps to their respective app stores.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN packaging is complete THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step Google Play Store upload instructions
2. WHEN iOS build is ready THEN the system SHALL provide App Store Connect submission guidelines
3. WHEN providing instructions THEN the system SHALL include signing requirements and certificate setup
4. WHEN documentation is generated THEN the system SHALL include troubleshooting tips for common deployment issues
5. WHEN final deliverables are ready THEN the system SHALL summarize all generated files and their purposes
